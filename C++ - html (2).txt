C++ is a general-purpose programming language.
C++ is used to create computer programs. Anything from art applications, 
music players and even video games!
C++ was derived from C, and is largely based on it.

Your First C++ Program

The next line, cout << "Hello world!"; results in the display of "Hello world!" 
to the screen.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello world!";
  return 0;
}

Let's break down the parts of the code.
#include <iostream>

C++ offers various headers, each of which contains information needed 
for programs to work properly.
 This particular program calls for the header <iostream>.
The number sign (#) at the beginning of a line targets the compiler's 
pre-processor. In this case, #include tells the pre-processor to include 
the <iostream> header. 
The <iostream> header defines the standard stream objects that input and 
output data.

The C++ compiler ignores blank lines.
In general, blank lines serve to improve the code's readability and structure. 
Whitespace, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, is also ignored, although it 
is used to enhance the program's visual attractiveness.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello world!";
  return 0;
}

In our code, the line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use
 the std (standard) namespace.
The std namespace includes features of the C++ Standard Library.

Main

Program execution begins with the main function, int main().
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello world!";
  return 0;
}

Curly brackets { } indicate the beginning and end of a function, which can 
also be called the function's body. The information inside the brackets 
indicates what the function does when executed.
The entry point of every C++ program is main(), irrespective of what the
program does.

The next line, cout << "Hello world!"; results in the display of
 "Hello world!" to the screen.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  cout << "Hello world!";
  return 0;
}

Statements

A block is a set of logically connected statements, surrounded by opening and 
closing curly braces.
For example:
{
  cout << "Hello world!"; 
  return 0;
}

You can have multiple statements on a single line, as long as you remember
 to end each statement with a semicolon. Failing to do so will result in an error.
